This folder computes the CCI index developed in 'Getting through: communicating complex information' Bank of England Staff Working Paper 1,047 and CEPR Discussion Paper 18,357. 

Instructions: 

Save all files / scripts / dataframes in this repository in your own local folder. 

Run CCI_compute to compute the CCI. 

This will require the packages specified in that script. 

The user will need to replace the text dataframe in Step 1, following the instructions in the script. 

Then the file will run the source code from CCI_functions, and spit out a dataframe with the jargon, some other helpful information values, and, crucially, the CCI.
